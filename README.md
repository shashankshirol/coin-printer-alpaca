# coin-printer-alpaca
An amateur algorithmic trading bot built on the ~IBKR~ Alpaca Web API for testing the API's capability and usefulness in building production-grade trading bot. The aim of this repository is to test out various trading strategies to quantitatively assess the money-making potential of the strategies.

*The IBKR API was expensive to set up* - Tough Luck.
